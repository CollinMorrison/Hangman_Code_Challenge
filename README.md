# Hangman_Code_Challenge
  For my project, the only notes/writing I did was to write the list of 10 words to include in my program. I coded this program in CLion, using C++.
  
  Other than that, my general approach to this program was to code the introduction, then create a separate function in which to test the user's guesses until they got the word correct. Under that framework, I added pieces that were needed to fulfil the requirements of the project.
